# Tile Flipper
This is a simple javascript application to illustrate a logic puzzle

The puzzle goes something like this: suppose you have an 8x8 grid of tile, with a square of 4 tiles in each 
corner being black. Tiles can be flipped (changed from black to white or from white to black), but only in an entire row or column. Try and make every tile the same color.
